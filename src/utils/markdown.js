module.exports = "# The Netherlands could become the first country with streets made of recycled plastic\n\nThink of it as a real-life LEGO set. Dutch-based construction company VolkerWessels announced plans to develop a recycled plastic surfacing material that is more durable than asphalt, which the city of Rotterdam is considering testing out on its streets. The project is a part of a larger initiative to rid the seas of “plastic soup.”\n\nAsphalt, according to VolkerWessels, contributes 1.6 million tons of CO2 to the atmosphere each year, which constitutes 2% of all road transport emissions, reports the Guardian.\n\n![image of car](http://d1xkznn4xi27rh.cloudfront.net/vw.jpg)\n\nThe material is still but a concept on paper but the company told the Guardian its aim is to lay its first fully plastic road within the next three years. As illustrated by the rendering below, the designed material would be hollow, making it a lighter and cheaper material than asphalt to haul and install (partly because the plastic segments would be pre-fabricated in a factory before laying them on the road).\n\nThe plastic road material, according to [VolkerWessels](http://www.volkerwessels.com/), would require less maintenance and last three times longer than *conventional* asphalt. And it would also be able to withstand more extreme temperatures, between -40 to 176 degrees Farenheit (-40 to 80 degrees Celsius).";
