      <p><em><b>tl;dr:</b></em> I'm currently a student at Boston College, studying computer science and economics. I'm also the captain of the men's rowing team. Academics and athletics take up a significant amount of my time, but when I do have a free moment, I'm probably hacking on a project in Python or JavaScript or painting some sort of sudo-surrealist landscape.</p>
